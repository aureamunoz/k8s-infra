=== Become a Docker Machine 11

==== Mac OSX

As the MacOS operating system doesnâ€™t natively support `+Linux container+`, it is then required to run a `+Linux+` vm using either `+Virtualbox+`, `+Xhyve+` or `+Hyperkit+` as hypervisor.

Various tools, approaches exist to turn your mac into a `+Containerized+` platform and are presented hereafter.

===== Docker Desktop

The new `+Docker Machine+` tool is available now as a `+Client desktop+` which can be installed as described here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/ This new client replaces `+docker-machine or docker tools+` and uses natively `+Hyperkit+` which is lightweight macOS virtualization solution built on top of `+Hypervisor.framework+` in macOS. Docker Desktop does not use https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/[docker-machine] to provision its VM. The Docker Engine API is exposed on a socket available to the Mac host at /var/run/docker.sock

===== Docker machine

Deprecated !

Docker machine is a client Tool communicating with the `+Virtualbox+` hypervisor and able to manage Linux VMs. Using docker-machine commands, you can start, inspect, stop, and restart a managed host, upgrade the Docker client and daemon, and configure a Docker client to talk to your host.

* Why or when to use it ?
** For linux container development and testing
** To bootstrap `+OpenShift+` using the `+oc cluster up+` command. This approach is not recommended and the link:[Minishift tool] should then be used for that purpose.
* Prerequisites
** https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtualbox]
* Follow installation instructions for Docker machine at https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/ or execute the following commands within a terminal.
+
*WARNING*: Change the version of the `+docker-machine+` according to the latest version published https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/[here]
+
[source,bash]
----
base=https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.14.0 &&
curl -L $base/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine &&
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
----
* Alternatively, if you prefer to install `+Docker+` using the docker package that you can download from https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg[here], then the following tools including docker machine will be also installed :
** Docker client
** Docker compose
** Docker machine
** Docker credential osxkeychain
* To verify, validate if docker machine works with Virtualbox, then execute this command to create a vm named `+default+` using a lightweight linux distribution - https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker[boot2docker]
+
[source,bash]

docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
